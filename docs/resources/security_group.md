# numspot_security_group (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "numspot_security_group" "test" {
  net_id      = numspot_vpc.net.id
  name        = "name"
  description = "description"

  inbound_rules = [
    {
      from_port_range = 80
      to_port_range   = 80
      ip_ranges       = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      ip_protocol     = "tcp"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) A description for the security group, with a maximum length of 255 [ASCII printable characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).
- `name` (String) The name of the security group.<br />
This name must not start with `sg-`.</br>
This name must be unique and contain between 1 and 255 ASCII characters. Accented letters are not allowed.

### Optional

- `inbound_rules` (Attributes List) The inbound rules associated with the security group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--inbound_rules))
- `net_id` (String) The ID of the Net for the security group.
- `outbound_rules` (Attributes List) The outbound rules associated with the security group. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--outbound_rules))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the security group.

### Nested Schema for `inbound_rules`

Optional:

- `from_port_range` (Number) The beginning of the port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP type number.

- `to_port_range` (Number) The end of the port range for the TCP and UDP protocols, or an ICMP code number.

Read-Only:

- `security_groups_members` (Attributes List) Information about one or more source or destination security groups. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--inbound_rules--security_groups_members))
