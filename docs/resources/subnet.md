# numspot_subnet (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "numspot_net" "net" {
  ip_range = "10.0.0.0/16"
}

# Create a private subnet
resource "numspot_subnet" "private" {
  net_id   = numspot_net.net.id
  ip_range = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

# Create a public subnet (should have an internet_service)
resource "numspot_subnet" "public" {
  net_id                  = numspot_net.net.id
  ip_range                = "10.0.2.0/24"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
}

## Schema

### Required

- `ip_range` (String) The IP range in the Subnet, in CIDR notation (for example, `10.0.0.0/16`).<br />
The IP range of the Subnet can be either the same as the Net one if you create only a single Subnet in this Net, or a subset of the Net one. In case of several Subnets in a Net, their IP ranges must not overlap. The smallest Subnet you can create uses a /29 netmask (eight IPs). For more information, see [About VPCs](https://docs.outscale.com/en/userguide/About-VPCs.html).
- `net_id` (String) The ID of the Net for which you want to create a Subnet.

### Optional

- `subregion_name` (String) The name of the Subregion in which you want to create the Subnet.

### Read-Only

- `available_ips_count` (Number) The number of available IPs in the Subnets.
- `id` (String) The ID of the Subnet.
- `map_public_ip_on_launch` (Boolean) If true, a public IP is assigned to the network interface cards (NICs) created in the specified Subnet.
- `state` (String) The state of the Subnet (`pending` \| `available` \| `deleted`).
