# numspot_postgres_cluster (Resource)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "numspot_postgres_cluster" "postgres-cluster" {
  name = "terraform-resource"
  user = "team.terraform"
  node_configuration = {
    vcpu_count        = 2
    performance_level = "MEDIUM"
    memory_size_gi_b  = 2
  }
  automatic_backup = false
  volume = {
    type      = "IO1",
    iops      = 200,
    size_gi_b = 10
  }
  allowed_ip_ranges = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `allowed_ip_ranges` (List of String)
- `automatic_backup` (Boolean) Whether automatic backup is enabled for this cluster.
- `name` (String) A strict slug: starts and ends with an alphanumeric character, allows hyphens or underscores in between but not consecutively or at the edges.
- `node_configuration` (Attributes) The configuration used to provision the cluster nodes. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--node_configuration))
- `user` (String) The name of the user with administration privileges on the cluster.
- `volume` (Attributes) Common properties to all volume types. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--volume))

### Optional

- `port` (Number) On which port connections to the host must be made.
- `private_host` (String) Where connections to the cluster must be made for interconnected services.
- `status` (String) The last known status of a cluster.

- CREATING: means the cluster is being created.
- CONFIGURING: means the cluster is being configured according to requested changes.
- READY: means the cluster is available and accepts connections.
- FAILED: means that the cluster creation has failed, see errorMessage for details.
- DELETING: means the cluster has been marked for deletion, it will be deleted soon.
