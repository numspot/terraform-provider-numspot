- `link_nic_vm_ids` (List of String) The ID of the VM.
- `link_public_ip_ids` (List of String) (Required in a Net) The ID representing the association of the public IP with the VM or the NIC.
- `link_public_ip_public_ip_ids` (List of String) The allocation ID of the public IP.
- `link_public_ip_public_ips` (List of String) The public IP associated with the NIC.
- `mac_addresses` (List of String) The Media Access Control (MAC) address of the NIC.
- `private_dns_names` (List of String) The name of the private DNS.
- `private_ips_is_primary` (Boolean) If true, the IP is the primary private IP of the NIC.

- `security_group_ids` (List of String) The ID of the security group.
- `security_group_names` (List of String) The name of the security group.
- `states` (List of String) The state of the NIC (`available` \| `attaching` \| `in-use` \| `detaching`).
- `subnet_ids` (List of String) The ID of the Subnet.
- `tag_keys` (List of String) The key of the tag, with a minimum of 1 character.
- `tag_values` (List of String) The value of the tag, between 0 and 255 characters.
- `tags` (List of String) The key/value combination of the tags associated with the DHCP options sets, in the following format: "Filters":{"Tags":["TAGKEY=TAGVALUE"]}.
