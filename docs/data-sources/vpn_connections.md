# numspot_vpn_connections (Data Source)



## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "numspot_client_gateway" "client-gateway" {
  connection_type = "ipsec.1"
  public_ip       = "192.0.0.0"
  bgp_asn         = 123456
}

resource "numspot_virtual_gateway" "virtual-gateway" {
  connection_type = "ipsec.1"
}

resource "numspot_vpn_connection" "vpn-connection" {
  client_gateway_id  = numspot_client_gateway.client-gateway.id
  connection_type    = "ipsec.1"
  virtual_gateway_id = numspot_virtual_gateway.virtual-gateway.id
  static_routes_only = false
}

data "numspot_vpn_connections" "datasource-vpn-connection" {
  depends_on = [numspot_vpn_connection.vpn-connection]
}

resource "null_resource" "print-datasource-id" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo data.numspot_vpn_connections.datasource-vpn-connection.items.0.id"
  }
}

## Schema

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `client_gateway_configuration` (String) Example configuration for the client gateway.
- `client_gateway_id` (String)
- `connection_type` (String) The type of VPN connection (always `ipsec.1`).
- `id` (String) The ID of the VPN connection.
- `routes` (Attributes List) Information about one or more static routes associated with the VPN connection, if any. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--routes))
- `state` (String) The state of the VPN connection (`pending` \| `available` \| `deleting` \| `deleted`).
- `static_routes_only` (Boolean) If false, the VPN connection uses dynamic routing with Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). If true, routing is controlled using static routes. For more information about how to create and delete static routes, see [CreateVpnConnectionRoute](#createvpnconnectionroute) and [DeleteVpnConnectionRoute](#deletevpnconnectionroute).
- `vgw_telemetries` (Attributes List) Information about the current state of one or more of the VPN tunnels. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--vgw_telemetries))
- `virtual_gateway_id` (String)
- `vpn_options` (Attributes) Information about the VPN options. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--vpn_options))

<a id="nestedatt--items--routes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.routes`

Read-Only:

- `destination_ip_range` (String) The IP range used for the destination match, in CIDR notation (for example, `10.0.0.0/24`).
- `route_type` (String) The type of route (always `static`).
- `state` (String) The current state of the static route (`pending` \| `available` \| `deleting` \| `deleted`).


<a id="nestedatt--items--vgw_telemetries"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.vgw_telemetries`

Read-Only:

- `accepted_route_count` (Number) The number of routes accepted through BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) route exchanges.
- `last_state_change_date` (String) The date and time (UTC) of the latest state update.
- `outside_ip_address` (String) The IP on the NumSpot side of the tunnel.
- `state` (String) The state of the IPSEC tunnel (`UP` \| `DOWN`).
- `state_description` (String) A description of the current state of the tunnel.


<a id="nestedatt--items--vpn_options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.vpn_options`

Read-Only:

- `phase1options` (Attributes) Information about Phase 1 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) negotiation. When Phase 1 finishes successfully, peers proceed to Phase 2 negotiations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--vpn_options--phase1options))
- `phase2options` (Attributes) Information about Phase 2 of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) negotiation. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--vpn_options--phase2options))
- `tunnel_inside_ip_range` (String) The range of inside IPs for the tunnel. This must be a /30 CIDR block from the 169.254.254.0/24 range.

<a id="nestedatt--items--vpn_options--phase1options"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.vpn_options.phase1options`

- `phase1lifetime_seconds` (Number) The lifetime for phase 1 of the IKE negotiation process, in seconds.
- `replay_window_size` (Number) The number of packets in an IKE replay window.
- `startup_action` (String) The action to carry out when establishing tunnels for a VPN connection.
