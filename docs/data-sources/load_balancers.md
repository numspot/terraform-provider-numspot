<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `load_balancer_names` (List of String) Load balancer names to filter with.

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `application_sticky_cookie_policies` (Attributes List) The stickiness policies defined for the load balancer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--application_sticky_cookie_policies))
- `availability_zone_names` (List of String) The ID of the Subregion in which the load balancer was created.
- `backend_ips` (List of String) One or more public IPs of back-end VMs.
- `backend_vm_ids` (List of String) One or more IDs of back-end VMs for the load balancer.
- `dns_name` (String) The DNS name of the load balancer.
- `health_check` (Attributes) Information about the health check configuration. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--health_check))
- `id` (String) ID for ReadLoadBalancers
- `listeners` (Attributes List) The listeners for the load balancer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--listeners))
- `name` (String) The name of the load balancer.
- `public_ip` (String) (internet-facing only) The public IP associated with the load balancer.
- `secured_cookies` (Boolean) Whether secure cookies are enabled for the load balancer.
- `security_groups` (List of String) One or more IDs of security groups for the load balancers. Valid only for load balancers in a Net.
- `source_security_group` (Attributes) Information about the source security group of the load balancer, which you can use as part of your inbound rules for your registered VMs.<br />
To only allow traffic from load balancers, add a security group rule that specifies this source security group as the inbound source. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--source_security_group))
- `sticky_cookie_policies` (Attributes List) The policies defined for the load balancer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--sticky_cookie_policies))
- `subnets` (List of String) The ID of the Subnet in which the load balancer was created.
- `type` (String) The type of load balancer. Valid only for load balancers in a Net.<br />
If `LoadBalancerType` is `internet-facing`, the load balancer has a public DNS name that resolves to a public IP.<br />
If `LoadBalancerType` is `internal`, the load balancer has a public DNS name that resolves to a private IP.
- `vpc_id` (String) The ID of the Net for the load balancer.
