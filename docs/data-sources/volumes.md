## Schema

### Optional

- `availability_zone_names` (List of String) The names of the Subregions in which the volumes were created.
- `creation_dates` (List of String) The dates and times of creation of the volumes, in ISO 8601 date-time format (for example, 2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z).
- `ids` (List of String) The IDs of the volumes.
- `link_volume_delete_on_vm_deletion` (Boolean) Whether the volumes are deleted or not when terminating the VMs.
- `link_volume_device_names` (List of String) The VM device names.
- `link_volume_link_dates` (List of String) The dates and times of creation of the volumes, in ISO 8601 date-time format (for example, 2020-06-30T00:00:00.000Z).
- `link_volume_link_states` (List of String) The attachment states of the volumes (attaching | detaching | attached | detached).
- `link_volume_vm_ids` (List of String) One or more IDs of VMs.
- `snapshot_ids` (List of String) The snapshots from which the volumes were created.
- `volume_sizes` (List of Number) The sizes of the volumes, in gibibytes (GiB).
- `volume_states` (List of String) The states of the volumes (creating | available | in-use | updating | deleting | error).
- `volume_types` (List of String) The types of the volumes (standard | gp2 | io1).

### Read-Only

### Nested Schema for `items.linked_volumes`

Read-Only:
